title: Rivet Design System
---
Our goal is to make it easier for teams to design and develop great experiences for users across all UITS applications.

This site is a preview of the Rivet source. It's where we develop new features and components and is not always stable. For that reason you should **always** reference the official Rivet documentation site at [rivet.iu.edu](https://rivet.iu.edu/).

## What is this?

What you are looking at is the authoring environment for our design system. This is where we'll be putting our components through their paces—designing, developing, testing, and eventually distributing them as a package for designers and developers to use in their projects.

We are using [Fractal](http://fractal.build/) to build and document components for Rivet. Fractal is a component library generator written in Node.js.

## Principles

**Be clear.**

Make design decisions based on user needs. Design interfaces that help our users accomplish their goals quickly and easily.

**Be flexible.**

Our design system is for all types of IU applications, even ones that have yet to be imagined. We need to design and build for flexibility.

**Be productive.**

Done is better than perfect. Iteration is only half the battle. Testing with users could reveal issues or questions we didn’t anticipate.
