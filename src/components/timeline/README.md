# Timeline
The timeline component can be used to visualize a series of events, deadlines, or other time-relevant material.

## When to use
- Your website or app needs to display a series of time-related events/activities that require further explanation

## When to consider something else
- When communicating where users are in a process, use the Step Indicator
- For normal lists, use ordered lists or unordered lists

## Implementation notes
- Keep date labels short (a date, season, year, or other temporal descriptions)
