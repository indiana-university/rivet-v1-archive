# Menu
- A menu is a list of app/site navigation links
- It is used to provide additional navigation outside of the main site/application header
- Use menus to let users easily navigate between pages in a section of a website or application
- By default menus display in a vertical list. Use the `--responsive` modifier to make a menu display as an inline list on larger screens.
- Use [Rivet icons](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-icons), [badges](https://rivet.iu.edu/components/page-content/badges/), and [spacing](https://rivet.iu.edu/components/layout/spacing/) utility classes to add more emphasis to menu items.
